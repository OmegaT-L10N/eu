  <title>Glossaries</title>

  <para>Glossaries are files created and updated manually for use in
  <application>OmegaT</application>.</para>

  <para>If an <application>OmegaT</application> project contains one or more
  glossaries, any terms in the glossary which are also found in the current
  segment will be automatically displayed in the Glossary viewer.</para>

  <para>You define its location and name in the project properties dialog. The
  extension must be <filename>.txt</filename> or <filename>.utf8</filename>
  (if not, it will be added). The location of the file must be within the
  <filename>/glossary</filename> folder, but it can be in a deeper folder
  (e.g., <filename>glossary/sub/glossary.txt</filename>). The file does not
  need to exist when setting it, it will be created (if necessary) when adding
  a glossary entry. If the file already exists, no attempt is done to verify
  the format or the character set of the file: the new entries will always be
  in tab-separated format and UTF-8. As the existing content will not be
  touched, damage to an existing file would be limited.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Usage</title>

    <para>To use an existing glossary, simply place it in the
    <filename>/glossary</filename> folder after creating the project.
    <application>OmegaT</application> automatically detects glossary files in
    this folder when a project is opened. Terms in the current segment which
    <application>OmegaT</application> finds in the glossary file(s) are
    displayed in the Glossary pane:</para>

    </figure>

    <para>The word before the = sign is the source term, and its translation
    is (or are) the words after =. The vocabulary entry can have a comment
    added. The glossary function only finds exact matches with the glossary
    entry (e.g. does not find inflected forms etc.). New terms can be added
    manually to the glossary file(s) during translation, for example in a text
    editor. Newly added terms will not be recognized once the changes in the
    text file have been saved.</para>

    <para>The source term does not have to be a single-word item, as the next
    example shows:</para>

      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>The underlined item &quot;pop-up menu&quot; can be found in the glossary pane
    as &quot;pojavni menu&quot;. Highlighting it in the Glossary pane and then
    rightclicking insets at the cursor position in the target
    segment.<footnote>
        <para>Note that in the above case, this is just half (or even less) of
        the story, as the target language (Slovenian) uses declension. So the
        inserted &quot;pojavni meni&quot; in the nominative form - has to be changed to
        &quot;pojavnem meniju&quot; , i.e. to the locative. So it is probably faster to
        type the term correctly right away without bothering with the glossary
        and its shortcuts.</para>
      </footnote></para>

  <section>
    <title>File format</title>

    <para>Glossary files are simple plain text files containing three-column,
    tab-delimited lists with the source and target terms in the first and
    second columns respectively. The third column can be used for additional
    information. You can have entries with the target column missing, i.e.
    just containing the source term and the comment.</para>

    <para>The encoding of glossaries is determined automatically. Of course,
    the encoding must be compatible with both the languages contained, so
    Unicode is recommended.</para>

    <para>Also supported is the CSV format. This format is the same as the tab
    separated one: source term, target term. Comment fields are separated by a
    comma ','. Strings can be enclosed by quotes &quot;, which allows having a
    comma inside a string:</para>

    <para><literal>&quot;This is a source term, which contains a comma&quot;,&quot;c'est un
    terme, qui contient une virgule&quot;</literal></para>

    <para>In addition to the plain text format, TBX format is also supported as a read-only glossary format. The
    location of the <filename>.tbx</filename> file must be within the
    <filename>/glossary</filename> folder, but it can be in a deeper folder
    (e.g., <filename>glossary/sub/MyGlossary.tbx</filename>).</para>

    <para>TBX - Term Base eXchange - is the open, XML-based standard for
    exchanging structured terminological data, TBX has been approved as an
    international standard by LISA and ISO. If you have an existing
    terminology handling system it is quite possible it offers the export of
    terminology data via TBX format. <ulink url="http://www.microsoft.com/Language/en-US/Terminology.aspx">Microsoft
    Terminology Collection</ulink> can be downloaded in nearly 100 languages and can serve as
    a cornerstone IT glossary.</para>

    <para>Note: the <filename>.tbx</filename> output of MultiTerm seems to not
    be reliable (November 2013), it is better to use the
    <filename>.tab</filename> output of MultiTerm instead.</para>

    <title>How to create glossaries</title>

    <para>The project setting allows one to enter a name for a writable
    glossary file (see beginning of this chapter). Right-click in the glossary
    pane or press <keycap>Ctrl+Shift+G</keycap> to add a new entry. A dialog
    opens, allowing you to enter the source term, target term and any comments
    you may have:</para>

    <mediaobject role="html">
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="images/GlossaryEntry_25.png"/>
      </imageobject>

      <imageobject role="fo">
        <imagedata fileref="images/GlossaryEntry_25.png" width="80%"/>
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>

    <para>The contents of glossary files are kept in memory and are loaded
    when the project is opened or reloaded. Updating a glossary file is thus
    rather simple: press <keycap>Ctrl+Shift+G</keycap> and enter the new term,
    its translation and any comments you may have (ensuring you press tab
    between the fields) and save the file. The contents of the glossary pane
    will be updated accordingly.</para>

    <para>The location of the writable glossary file can be set in the
    <guimenuitem>Project &gt; Properties ... </guimenuitem>dialog. The
    recognized extensions are <filename>TXT</filename> and
    <filename>UTF8</filename></para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Note: </emphasis>Of course there are other
    ways and means to create a simple file with tab delimited entries. Nothing
    speaks against using Notepad++ on Windows, GEdit on Linux for instance or
    some spreadsheet program for this purpose: any application, that can
    handle UTF-8 (or UTF-16 LE) and that can show white space (so that you do
    not miss the required <keycap>TAB</keycap> characters) can be used.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Priority glossary</title>

    <para>The results from the priority glossary (by default,
    glossary/glossary.txt) appear in first places in the Glossary pane and in
    TransTips.</para>

    <para>As entries can mix words from priority and non priority glossaries,
    the words from the priority glossary are displayed in bold.</para>
